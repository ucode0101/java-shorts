    Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many
    classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

    The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent
    class reference is used to refer to a child class object

    Reference type can be class or interface ,
    object can be any extending or implementing child class

    abstract class and interface can only be reference type,
    which means we cannot create an object of interface and abstract class
