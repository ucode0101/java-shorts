    /*
       Abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to hide the
       implementation details of a class from its users

       Abstraction is hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user

       abstract keyword is used to create an abstract class and method
       abstract method: a method without the body "{}"
       abstract method meant to be overridden in subclass
       abstract class meant to be inherited
       We cannot create an object of abstract class
       When abstract class extended by a class, you must override all abstract methods in subclass

       Two ways to achieve abstraction:
       1. Abstract Class
       2. Interface
